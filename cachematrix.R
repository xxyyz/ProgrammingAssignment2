## a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix
## assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible

## creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed),
## then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
